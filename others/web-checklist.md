* [ ] User account lockout mechanism on brute force attack
* [ ] Check for password wordlist using cewl command
* [ ] Test 0auth login functionality for Open Redirection
* [ ] Test response tampering in SAML authentication

* [ ] Access controls
* [ ] Effectiveness of controls using multiple accounts
* [ ] Insecure access control methods \(request parameters, Referer header, etc\)
* [ ] Check for concurrent login through different machine/IP
* [ ] Bypass AntiCSRF tokens

### Profile/Account details

* [ ] Find parameter with user id and try to tamper in order to get the details of other users
* [ ] Create a list of features that are pertaining to a user account only and try CSRF
* [ ] Change email id and update with any existing email id. Check if its getting validated on server or not.
* [ ] Check any new email confirmation link and what if user doesn't confirm.
* [ ] File upload tests: Unsafe File upload,  No Antivirus, No Size Limit, File extension, Filter Bypass
* [ ] CSV import/export: Command Injection, XSS, macro injection

* [ ] Imagetragick in picture profile upload
* [ ] Metadata of all downloadable files
* [ ] Account deletion option and try to reactivate with "Forgot password" feature
* [ ] Try bruteforce enumeration when change any user unique parameter.
* [ ] Check application request re-authentication for sensitive operations
* [ ] Try parameter pollution to add two values of same field

### Forgot password

* [ ] Invalidate session on Logout and Password reset
* [ ] Uniqueness of forget password reset link/code
* [ ] Reset links expiration time
* [ ] Find user id or other sensitive fields in reset link and tamper them
* [ ] Request 2 reset passwords links and use the older
* [ ] Check if many requests have sequential tokens

## Input handling

* [ ] Fuzz all request parameters
* [ ] Identify all reflected data
* [ ] Reflected XSS
* [ ] HTTP header injection in GET & POST \(X Forwarded Host\)

* [ ] Stored attacks
* [ ] OS command injection
* [ ] Path traversal
* [ ] Script injection
* [ ] File inclusion
* [ ] SMTP injection
* [ ] Native software flaws \(buffer overflow, integer bugs, format strings\)
* [ ] SOAP injection
* [ ] LDAP injection
* [ ] XPath injection
* [ ] XXE in any request, change content-type to text/xml
* [ ] Stored XSS
* [ ] SQL injection
* [ ] NoSQL injection
* [ ] HTTP Request Smuggling
* [ ] Open redirect
* [ ] SSRF in previously discovered open ports
* [ ] DDOS xmlrpc.php
* [ ] HTTP dangerous methods OPTIONS PUT DELETE

### Error handling

* [ ] Access custom pages like /whatever\_fake.php \(.aspx,.html,.etc\)
* [ ] Add multiple parameters in GET and POST request using different values
* [ ] Add "\[\]", "\]\]", and "\[\[" in cookie values and parameter values to create errors
* [ ] Generate error by giving input as "/~randomthing/%s" at the end of URL
* [ ] Use Burp Intruder "Fuzzing Full" List in input to generate error codes
* [ ] Try different HTTP Verbs like PATCH, DEBUG or wrong like FAKE

## Application Logic

* [ ] Identify the logic attack surface
