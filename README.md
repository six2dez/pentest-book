### **Usage: Just use the search bar at the upper or navigate through the sections of the left zone. Enjoy it** :blush:&#x20;

**Don't you know where to go now?** Let me introduce you to some of the most **popular pages** on this wiki:

* Know your target! Make a proper [recon](recon/public-info-gathering.md)!
* What can you do in those strange [ports](enumeration/ports.md)?
* Doing a [web pentest](enumeration/web/)? Don't forget to check out any of these common attacks!
* Do you have the same hype as me with [cloud ](enumeration/cloud/)services? They also have their vulnerabilities
* Stuck again with Windows and [Kerberos](post-exploitation/windows/ad/kerberos-attacks.md)? Here is my cheatsheet
* The mobile world does not stop growing, see my tips for [Android ](mobile/android.md)and [iOS](mobile/ios.md)
* [Burp Suite ](others/burp.md)is the tool most loved by everyone, but you have to know a few tricks, also check my [preferred extensions](others/burp.md#preferred-extensions)
* I'm really proud of [Pentesting Web Checklist](others/web-checklist.md)
* If you want to know which web fuzzer fits you best, take a look at the [comparison](others/web-fuzzers-comparision.md).

**Important note**: I use this wiki daily for my work and I am constantly updating it. I'm very sorry if a link to a page changes or I move it, if you need something you are free to contact me.

You can support this work buying me a coffee:&#x20;
